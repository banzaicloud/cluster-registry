# Cluster Registry

This repository defines a lightweight Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition API
for defining a list of clusters and associated metadata in a K8s environment.

## What is it?

The cluster registry helps you keep track of and perform operations on your
clusters within one administrative domain. This repository doesn't contain
an actual implementation of a controller that uses the API.
